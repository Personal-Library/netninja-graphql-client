# Personal Reading List

## Description
This project was created for educational purposes only, by following along with The Net Ninja's introduction to GraphQL. It allows the user to select from favorite authors and add/search their favorite books.

At the time of this project, much of his guidance was out of date. I have completed the guide using Functional Components utilizing Apollo's hooks rather than class components.

## Technologies
